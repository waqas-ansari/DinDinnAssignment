# DinDinnAssignment
Please find the attached project assignment as required. The project is based on MVVM Design Pattern and uses Android Libraries for the implementation.

As required RxJava, Kotlin and MvRx Archietcture is used in building the application. Along with that, a unused network and Room DB layer has also been added by using Retrofit2 with RxJava and Android's Room DB. The data has been mocked and resides in memory.

Unfortunately, due to unavailability of time, the food cart screen is not designed as required (with tabs of Cart, Order and Information). Rest of the project is as per the requirement.

Hope it is considered.

Looking forward to soon hearing from you.

Thanks & Regards.
